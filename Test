    <h1> Messing Around </h1>
<p>My name is Theo. I currently work as a security guard at SpaceX. This very moment I am working the graveyard shift and its cold outside, 55 degrees according to the weather app on my iPhone.

 Being in this environment motivates me to improve and elevate myself. Specifically, my career options. I've always been pretty good at being able to navigate around computers and have had one since the year 2000. </p1>
<p2> My first experience with coding was with facebook. I honestly thought I was a hacker because I discovered how to change the text and color in images. It was a great feeling.
